# Snake
Visual C++ Snake for the Windows Console

This was the first C++ project I ever worked on a long time ago.
The code is mostly as it was when I initially wrote it so yes it is ugly, but I want to preserve it in that manner

This repository contains the source code and the Visual Studio solution as well as a compiled .exe
This code uses the windows.h header and will only work on windows as a result
